## Installation

### Prerequisite Tech Stacks

- [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Steps to Install

Set up the project locally on your machine by following these steps. 
Keep in mind, they are specific to using Windows.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AmberForrester/store_it
  ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  cd store_it
  ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:** 

Run the following command to install the project dependencies using npm:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project directory and add the following:
   ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=""
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE=""
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION=""
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_FILES_COLLECTION=""
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET=""
  NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY=""
   ```

Use the key provided after creating your account and new project with [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/). 

5. **Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`**

> [!CAUTION]
> To ensure your sensitive information does not get committed to version control:
  - Open (or create) the `.gitignore` file in the root directory.
  - Add the following line to the file:
   ```
   .env.local
   ```

This step will prevent the `.env.local` file from being tracked by Git and keep your sensitive credentials secure.
